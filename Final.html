 Welcome to my webpage, and thanks for visiting!<br> <br>You’re either visiting this website to 
 learn, because you or somebody you know, wants to become a better golfer. This site will 
 serve as an introduction to golf, utilizing videos and pictures, with accompanying descriptions 
 where applicable.  Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned veteran, there is always room for improvement 
 in the game of golf. You can navigate to my “Check Out The Action” portion of this site to see videos of 
 swings from varying levels of golfers. The “History” portion of this site will serve as a brief background
  of my involvement in the game. There is also a “Contact” page where you can reach out to me, as well as a 
  “Book a Lesson” page where you can directly book a lesson with me. <br><br> It is my hope that you will enjoy this 
  site and the content provided. Enjoy!
