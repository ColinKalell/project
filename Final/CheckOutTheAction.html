My Take On The Golf Swing <br>
I have seen thousands of swings over the years, 
ugly swings and pretty swings, but my biggest takeaway 
is a swing that can maximize performance. It doesn’t need 
to be pretty, but it needs to be effective and repeatable. 
Consistency is something most average golfers lack. My biggest 
thought with the golf swing is the hitting area, about a 2-foot area 
in transition between takeaway and follow-through. This is the area where
 impact occurs with the club and the ball. The only position I care about
  is getting the club face square in the impact zone. If the clubface is 
  square, it will maximize ball flight and trajectory. It will also provide
   the cleanest strike, and compression of the golf ball. There are many different 
   ways to get “square” at impact, we just need to find the one that works best for you! 
   <br> Have a look at some of the different levels of golf swings below!<br> Enjoy!</p></center></b>

<center> This student has a handicap of 27, which means he is on average 27 strokes over par. 
He is considered well below average, with a handicap of 15 being the average in 
the United States. He is obviously older, which limits flexibility within the swing. 
This is one of his best swings I have ever seen. He usually has an issue with shifting off the ball,
 and not staying centered over the ball. He does a good job of trying not to slide with his hips in this
  video. He doesn’t lunge at the ball, like he has a tendency to do. He stays long through impact, 
  extending his arms out towards the target. Towards the end of the video you can see him throw his
   hands up in celebration of his great swing! Seeing a student as happy as he was after this great 
   shot gives me a great sense of fulfillment.</center>
<br>
<br>
 <center><b><h1>Intermediate Golfer<b></h1><br><br></center>

This student has a handicap of 9, well below the national average. 
Like the novice golfer, he has a tendency to slide off the ball with his hips,
 versus rotating. He does not do this here. His setup is much better than the novice
  golfer, his posture in particular. He looks more “athletic” over the ball. 
  In this video, the intermediate golfer has a great takeaway, and generates a great 
  shoulder turn with his back rotating all the way towards the target. His transition
   from takeaway to downswing is seamless, and his extension through impact is also very strong.
    He continues that extension through his follow through, all while maintaining his athletic posture. 
    Great swing from the intermediate golfer! The only issue with him not becoming better is his inability 
    to repeat this motion time and time again.</center>

<center> These swings belong to John Daly (in the pants) and Lee Trevino (shorts). 
They combined to win 8 majors, golfs biggest tournaments. John has one of the longest 
swings around, meaning on his backswing he extends way past parallel. This helps him generate
 club head speed, which provides for an increase in distance. John was one of the first “bombers” 
 (golf lingo for long hitter) when he first broke on to the tour. This was the result of John having such a 
 long swing. John does a great job of maintaining balance, despite his abnormally long backswing. 
 John also does a great job of releasing the clubhead through the impact zone. He has a unique swing,
  but yet very effective. Lee has a much different swing, mainly because he is much older now and 
  restricted by lack of flexibility. In his younger years, he was bringing the club back much further
   in his takeaway. Lee still does a great job of accelerating on the downswing, and using a downward 
   strike to compress the golf ball and maximize efficiency on such a short swing. His swing resembles
    that of the novice golfer, in that it is short due to age and lack of flexibility. It might look similar,
     but the results are very different. Lee has a very polished and refined swing, and was probably one of 
     the best players I have ever seen, despite his age. Two different swings with John and Lee, 
     but both provided results and success on the worlds biggest stage. </center>
